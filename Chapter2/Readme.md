EXERCISE 2.5, pp. 36:
Design and conduct an experiment to demonstrate the difficulties that sample-average 
methods have for nonstationary problems. Use a modified version of the 10-armed testbed
in which all the q*(a) start out equal and then take independent random walks (say by 
adding a normally distributed increment with mean zero and standard deviation 0.01 to 
all the q*(a) on each step). Prepare plots like Figure 2.2 for an action-value method 
using sample averages, incrementally computed, and another action-value method using 
a constant step-size parameter, alpha = 0.1. Use epsilon = 0.1 and longer runs, say of 
10,000 steps.
